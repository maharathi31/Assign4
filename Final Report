The Harvard architecture has separate memory spaces for instructions and data, and these memory spaces are accessed by separate buses. This means that the processor can access both an instruction and a piece of data simultaneously, which can result in faster processing speeds.

The Von Neumann architecture, on the other hand, uses a single memory space for both instructions and data, and a single bus to access this memory space.

As we can see clearly from the above results, the harvard architecture has better performance utilization percentages even before optimising the C code.
